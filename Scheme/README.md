# Next2You Scheme

This folder contains two Google Colab notebooks that comprise the core functionality of the Next2You copresence detection scheme from the paper "Next2You: Robust Copresence Detection Based on Channel State Information", by Mikhail Fomichev, Luis F. Abanto-Leon, Max Stiegler, Alejandro Molina, Jakob Link, Matthias Hollick, in ACM Transactions on Internet of Things, vol. 1, Issue 1, 2021.

## Getting Started

The provided notebooks: *Next2You_2400_MHz.ipynb* and *Next2You_5000_MHz.ipynb* contain the implementation and evaluation of the Next2You copresence detection scheme. Each notebook includes the instructions and comments on how to use it. The results generated by these notebooks are either directly presented in the paper (referenced in the notebooks) or summarized [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5592823). 

The notebooks were executed in the [Google Colab environment](https://colab.research.google.com/) using *Python 3.7.12* with the following packages:

```
json==2.0.9
keras==2.6.0
numpy==1.19.5
sklearn==0.22.2.post1
tensorflow==2.6.0
```
